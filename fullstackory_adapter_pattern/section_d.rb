# The goal here is to use the obscenity gem to santize text
# More info about the gem here: https://github.com/tjackiw/obscenity

# Be sure to write tests!

# Hint: to add dependencies to a gem, you need to add them the the gemspec


# The ___ class is the 'adaptee'


# The ___ class is the 'Target'


# The ___ is the 'adapter'
